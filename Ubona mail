This is to update you that I have successfully completed all the tasks outlined in the Ubona deployment PDF provided. Below is a summary of the actions taken:

⸻

✅ Tasks Completed:
	•	Provisioned a VM using the Red Hat Enterprise Linux 9.6 (LVM) base image.
	•	Configured the VM with:
	•	Username: optumadmin
	•	SSH authentication via public key
	•	Disk layout checked and verified using df -h command
	•	Performed the pre-configuration assessment as instructed.
	•	Verified that the filesystem usage, mount points, and current disk sizes were consistent with expectations.

⸻

⚠️ Key Differences from the SOP Document:
	1.	Region Used:
	•	The VM was created in Central US instead of East US, due to a policy restriction (ubona-allowedregions) that prevents deployment in East US.
	•	This change was necessary to comply with organizational governance policies.
	2.	Network Access (SSH):
	•	A Bastion Host was deployed to enable secure SSH access to the VM, since direct internet traffic over port 22 is disallowed by policy.
	•	SSH to the VM was successfully tested through the Bastion host using the optumadmin user.

Please let me know if any further verification or additional steps are needed on my end.
